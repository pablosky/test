1: setup: dockerfiles and working env -> done  2 hrs
2: define data model -> events, value:[ good, bad,] description string -> done 30 min
3: expose data model with graphql -> 30 min part1 gems, part model_Typer 2, done
4: show data model in frontend -> done 
5: put some nice library to show data -> using bootstrap done.



6. update event
7. clean that variable called completed boolean on event
8. categories for event

must have: 

order data model: add name, value, done 
design and apply cleaner UI
add from to events query


nice to haves: 
1. some sort of service that does something more complicated
2. some way to load data faster
3. jest testing
